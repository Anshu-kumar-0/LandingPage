            <p>
              Covid-19 vaccines help protect people from severe illness, hospitalization, and death caused by the coronavirus.<br>
              Vaccines teach your immune system to recognize and fight the virus, often without having to get sick first.<br>
              Being vaccinated can also reduce the duration and seriousness of symptoms if infection occurs.<br>
            </p> 
            <p>
              COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people infected experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without special treatment. However, some individuals, especially older adults and those with underlying medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases, may develop severe illness requiring medical attention.<br>

              The virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets from coughs, sneezes, speaking, or breathing. Preventive measures include maintaining physical distance, wearing properly fitted masks, frequent hand washing, good respiratory hygiene, and vaccination. If symptoms appear, such as fever, cough, tiredness, or loss of taste and smell, it is advised to self-isolate and seek medical advice if serious symptoms like difficulty breathing occur.<br>

              COVID-19 symptoms range from mild (fever, cough, fatigue) to severe (shortness of breath, chest pain). Vaccination remains the best tool to reduce transmission and severity. The disease affects people differently, and anyone can become seriously ill regardless of age.
